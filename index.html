## UFO Sightings Over the Years

<div id="vis1"></div>

<p>
  This line chart visualizes the number of UFO sightings reported in the United States each year, as recorded in the dataset from the early 1900s to 2014.
  For the visual encoding, the x-axis represents the year (discrete), and the y-axis encodes the count of reports per year (quantitative). I used a line chart with point markers to emphasize trends and highlight each year's data clearly.
  In terms of data transformation, I first converted the original datetime field into a datetime object using pd.to_datetime(), and then extracted the year with dt.year to group the data.
  "This plot was not included in my Homework #5 submission." It is newly created for this assignment using Altair and JSON export for embedding in the Jekyll site.
  I used a tooltip interactivity so that viewers can hover over each point and see the exact year and number of reports. This enhances readability and makes it easy to spot peak years.

## UFO Shape Distribution by State

<div id="vis2"></div>

<p>
  This bar chart shows the distribution of reported UFO shapes for a selected U.S. state, limited to the top 20 states by total number of reports.
  The x-axis encodes the shape of the reported object, and the y-axis shows the total number of reports for that shape. Color is also mapped to the shape to help distinguish the bars. I sorted the shapes by descending count for easier comparison.
  For the data transformation, I first filtered the dataset to include only U.S. states and then selected the top 20 by frequency. I used this filtered dataset to populate the dropdown and generate the chart.
  "This plot was not part of my Homework #5 submission." It was created specifically for this assignment to fulfill the requirement for interactivity and web integration.
  I implemented interactive filtering using a dropdown menu, allowing the user to choose a state and dynamically update the bar chart based on that selection. This makes the chart more useful for comparison and allows for localized analysis without cluttering the screen.
