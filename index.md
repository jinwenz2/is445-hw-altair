## UFO Sightings Over the Years

<div id="vis1"></div>

<p>
This line chart visualizes the number of UFO sightings reported in the United States each year.  
It uses year on the x-axis and count on the y-axis.  
I added tooltip interactivity to enhance understanding of yearly patterns.

## UFO Shape Distribution by State

<div id="vis2"></div>

<p>
This bar chart shows the distribution of reported UFO shapes in each U.S. state (top 20).  
You can use the dropdown to select a state and explore its data.
